    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I live in Canandaigua, NY with my girlfriend, two sons, two dogs, cat, and a few hundred honeybees.  I love learning new words 
        and do my best to keep my lexicon adequately sharp.  It's important to me to keep picking up new skills or finding new ways to 
        express old ones.  It's safe to imagine that I have a song stuck in my head at any given moment of the day.
