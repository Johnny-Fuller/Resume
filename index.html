    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>By nature: I am support.  I choose my work carefully in such that I can be in a position that will help people shine brighter.  
        I believe that the whole of a team should always be greater than the sum of it's parts.  In this, I have found my career geared 
        towards teaching computer literacy and applying my knowledge to overcome troublesome knots in the tech world.  It is of the 
        utmost importance that I be in a position where I can learn new systems and have ample space to practice and refine new skills. </p>

            weekend, and online courses around my work schedule.  Fatherhood became the priority, and seeing as I already had an entry level position 
            at Kodak, I felt like I was on the right course.
